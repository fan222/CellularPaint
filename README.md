## Background

Cyclic Cellular Automata (CCA) exhibit complex self-organization by iteration of an extremely simple update rule. A specified number of Colors are arranged cyclically in a "color wheel." Each color can only advance to the next, the last cycling to 0. Each update a cell's color advances by 1 if there are at least Threshold cells of the next color within its neighbor set of size Range in extended Moore or von Neumann neighborhood. These simple dynamics exhibit complex self-organization starting from randomness.
